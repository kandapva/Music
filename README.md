Translating the SWARAS in a Raaga with constant Sthaanas.

This ipython notebook helps in translating the Swaras which will help the persons who like to render the Raaga in a shifted 
scale. This helps in achieving this for Carnatic/Classical notes. Arohanam and Avarohanam are given in the $A_u$ and $A_l$.
 The transalted Raaga's Aarohanam and Avarohanam can be taken as new. The file with classical notes will be translated and stored in a different file.
